## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my **Deep Learning Platform** organization! 

I am dedicated to create a comprehensive example for an end-to-end deep learning solution. My goal is to integrate various components to streamline model development, training, and deployment. 

### 🙋‍♀️ What is this organization all about?

It comprises several key repositories that work together to provide a complete solution for deep learning projects:

- **Infrastructure Modules**: Contains Terraform modules to define and manage cloud infrastructure.
- **Infrastructure Live**: Uses Terragrunt to provision and manage the infrastructure necessary for running our deep learning platform.
- **Data Registry**: Manages data versioning using DVC (Data Version Control) to keep track of datasets.
- **Training Pipeline**: Implements model training with PyTorch Lightning, focusing on scalable and efficient training processes.

### 👩‍💻 Useful Resources

- **[Infrastructure Modules Documentation](https://github.com/deep-learning-platform/infrastructure-modules#readme)**: Documentation for Terraform modules.
- **[Infrastructure Live Documentation](https://github.com/deep-learning-platform/infrastructure-live#readme)**: Guides on using Terragrunt for infrastructure provisioning.
- **[Data Registry Documentation](https://github.com/deep-learning-platform/data-registry#readme)**: Instructions for managing data with DVC.
- **[Training Pipeline Documentation](https://github.com/deep-learning-platform/training-pipeline#readme)**: Information on training models with PyTorch Lightning.

For more in-depth documentation, please check the individual README files in each repository.

### 🍿 Fun Facts

I am fueled by coffee and passionate discussions about machine learning! I believe in the power of collaboration and open-source to drive innovation.
